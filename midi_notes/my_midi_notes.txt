<HEADER>  = <HEADER_CHUNK_TYPE> + <HEADER_LENGTH>

        Must have value'MThd'
    <HEADER_LENTGH> (4B) -

<HEADER_DATA> = <FORMAT> + <NUM_TRACKS> + <DIVISION>
    <FORMAT> (2B)
        0 - the file contains a single multi-channel track
        1 - the file contains one or more simulatneous tracks
        2 - the file contains one or more sequential indenependant single-track patterns
    <NUM_TRACKS> (2B)
    <DIVISION> (2B)
        denotes the meaning of delta time.

<TRACK_EVENT> = <DELTA_TIME> + <EVENT>
    <DELTA_TIME> (variable length)

        which was set in the HEADER.

<EVENT> = <MIDI_EVENT> | <META_EVENT> | <SYSEX_EVENT>

<MIDI_EVENT> (3B?)
    Any MIDI channel message. The file format uses running-state

    54 05 hh mm ss fr ff - SMPTE Offset
        Please look up the appropriate docs. I don't really understand this
        part of it.

    58 04 nn dd cc bb- Time Signature
        Time signature in the form nn/(2^dd)
        nn (1B)

        dd (1B)
            denominator of the time signature
            describes as a power of 2.
        cc (1B)
            MIDI clocks per metronome tick
        bb (1B)
            Number of 1/32 notes pre 24 MIDI clocks (  8 is standar)

    59 02 sf mi - Key Signature

            -7 denotes 7 flats
            0 = key of C
            +7 denotes 7 sharps
        mi
            0 = major Key
            1 = minor key

    7F <len> <id> <data> - Sequence-Specific Meta Event
        MIDI file equilvalent of System exclusive messages.
        <len>(variable length)
            length of both the <id> and <data> sections in bytes
        <id> (1-3B)
            1 or 3 bytes used to represent the Manufacturur ID
        <data>
            8-bit binary data.



** Note MIDI has a 'variable length' data size
    BYTE1 - 8th bit is set to 1
    BYTE2 - 8th bit is set to 1
    ...
    BYTE<N> - 8th bit is set to 0
    The last bit has a 0 set in order to denote that the sequence has ended.

** High bytes are written first.
    Therefore in order to encode 0x0034
    you would write out 0x4300
